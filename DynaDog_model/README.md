## DynaDog v1.0

This script can be used to generate dogs from our shape model, which we are now calling DynaDog. For ease of comparison, this model has been structured similarly to SMPL, SMAL, etc.

You will need to set the base dataset directory path in "datasetFolder".

This code is based on smpl_np.py found at [https://github.com/benjiebob/SMPL](https://github.com/benjiebob/SMPL)
