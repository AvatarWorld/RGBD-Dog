We provide a simple GUI, using PyQT, to view the dataset. To run, please first edit the value for "pathToMainDataset", then execute:
```
cd path/to/RGBD-Dog/Source/Data_Viewer_GUI
python mocap_viewer.py
```

It can be used to view the scene from different viewpoints (cameras), projected skeleton and/or markers, and the different modalities (if available)
